# MobileOSP
This is not yet finished mobile app written entirely in Kotlin.
What does the app should do? It's going to be a simple database in form of mobile app which will be used to manage a fire brigade unit.
This is also my Engineering Thesis.
Full description will be available when the app is finished.
